# Performance Benchmarks and Optimization

## Repository Size Categories

| Repository Size | File Count | Approximate Lines of Code |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Small           | <100 files | <20,000 LOC              |
| Medium          | <1,000 files | <200,000 LOC           |
| Large           | <10,000 files | <2,000,000 LOC        |
| Enterprise      | >10,000 files | >2,000,000 LOC        |

## Performance Targets

| Operation              | Small Repo | Medium Repo | Large Repo | Enterprise Repo |
|------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Initial Scan           | <5s        | <30s       | <3m        | <10m            |
| File Filtering         | <1s        | <5s        | <30s       | <2m             |
| LLM Processing (Total) | <2m        | <15m       | <2h        | Custom Planning |
| Markdown Generation    | <3s        | <20s       | <3m        | <15m            |
| Total Process Time     | <3m        | <20m       | <2.5h      | Custom Planning |

## Memory Usage Guidelines

| Repository Size | Peak Memory | Recommended RAM |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Small           | <200MB      | 4GB             |
| Medium          | <500MB      | 8GB             |
| Large           | <1.5GB      | 16GB            |
| Enterprise      | >2GB        | 32GB+           |

## Optimization Strategies

- Implement progressive loading for large repositories
- Apply multi-threading for file scanning and processing
- Control concurrency based on system resources
- Cache intermediate results for interrupted operations
- Support resume functionality for LLM processing
- Use memory-mapped files for large repositories
- Apply adaptive chunking based on file content complexity
- Implement token usage throttling for cost-effective processing
- Offer batch mode for unattended operation on large repositories
- Provide detailed performance metrics and diagnostics
